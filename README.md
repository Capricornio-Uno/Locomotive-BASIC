# Locomotive-BASIC
Funny little programs that you can run on any Amstrad CPC emulator

Locomotive BASIC is a programming language that appeared in 1984 for the AMSDOS OS in the Amstrad family of computers 
(CPC464, 664 and 6128)

Maybe it could be considered something like the "Python" of that era.
